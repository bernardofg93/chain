                    One of our main modes of transportation, intermodal 
                    is used to transport everything from corn oil to garden 
                    hoses to solar panels. Why intermodal?It’s not only a smart
                    move for shippers but for the environment, too. When you depend 
                    on BlockChain to ship via intermodal, you benefit from:

            <h1>Reduce your Carbon Footprint</h1>
            <p>
                Intermodal transportation is an attractive 
                alternative to truckload shipments. Trains are, 
                on average, four times more fuel-efficient than trucks, 
                which means greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by 75 percent. 
                By transferring your truckload freight to rail, you reduce congestion 
                on America’s highways and improve fuel efficiency—you can move one ton of 
                freight 480 miles on a single gallon of fuel. Blockchain is always on the prowl 
                for opportunities to reduce its carbon footprint as well as that of our customers. 
                Find out how much you’re helping the environment by shipping intermodal.

            <p>
                If the product is dense enough and the distance 
                to travel is far enough, carload rail shipping can be 
                an ideal fit—even for overdimensional freight. Blockchain 
                Logistic's  manages every aspect of the rail lane from door to door. 
                We use boxcars, flatcars, gondolas, tanker cars, hopper cars, and more, 
                and we provide a rail-versus-truck analysis to ensure your freight moves 
                on the right equipment for the right price
