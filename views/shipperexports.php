            Today, it is more practical than ever for a company like yours, 
            regardless of size, to sell goods and services across the globe. 
            95 percent of the world’s potential consumers are outside of the United States, 
            and the global affinity for Made in USA products and services is second to none. 
            Many exporters continue to boost their bottom line and build their competitiveness 
            by selling to world markets, and you can too. The internet, improved logistics options,
            and array of federal, state, and local export assistance has made exporting more viable 
            for even the smallest businesses. In 2017, the value of U.S. good services exports was an 
            impressive $2.3 trillion. And as thousands of exporters can attest, diversifying your customer 
            base through exporting can help to weather changes in the domestic and global economies.

            An export transaction is a transaction in which the U.S. Principal Party in Interest (USPPI) 
            receives payment from a foreign buyer and files or authorizes an authorized agent to prepare 
            and file the Electronic Export Information. If the USPPI authorizes an agent to file on its 
            behalf, the USPPI must provide the authorized agent with written authorization or a power of 
            attorney, as well as determine if a license is required.

        </h1>
        <p>
            was a standard United States government form required for all U.S. 
            exports with commodities valued at US$2,500 or higher. It has been 
            replaced with the Electronic Export Information form (EEI)
        </p>
        <p>
            Electronic Export Information (EEI)
            is the export data filed in the Automated Export System (AES). 
            This is the electronic equivalent of the export information formerly 
            filed on the Shipper’s Export Declaration. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If a single commodity's value within a U.S. export shipment exceeds US$2,500.00,
            then an EEI must be filed with the U.S. Census Bureau. The EEI is used by the U.S. 
            Census Bureau to compile trade statistics and exert export controls.

            </h1>
            <p>
                The Electronic Export Information (EEI) needs to be filed when the value 
                of the commodity classified under each individual Schedule B number or 
                HTSUSA commodity classification is over $2,500 or if a validated export 
                license is required to export the commodity. The exporter is responsible 
                for preparing the EEI and the carrier files it with U.S. Customs and Border 
                Protection (CBP) through the AES or AES Direct. Prior to exporting, the exporter 
                should acquire the Schedule B number or HTSUSA commodity classification for the 
                commodity they intend to export. The Schedule B number or HTSUSA commodity classification 
                must be reported in the AES to identify the goods being exported. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If the exporter is sending baggage or containers with their personal or household goods     
                valued over $2,500 to a foreign destination, other than Canada, they must file the EEI     
                and provide the ITN to the carrier in accordance with the timeline.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the U.S. Principal Party in Interest (USPPI) is sending goods through the U.S. Postal     
                Service, they are required to file the EEI only if the entire shipment is valued over $2,500     
                per Schedule B or if it requires an export license. The exporter should submit the ITN or     
                exemption citation to the post office.

            Who files the EEI?
            In a standard export transaction, it is the responsibility 
            of the U.S. Principal Party in Interest (USPPI). 
            However, the USPPI can give Blockchain Logistics LLC 
            (U.S. Authorized )a power of attorney (POA) or written 
            statement authorizing them to prepare and file the EEI on their behalf. 
            (In most cases, the USPPI is the same as the exporter.)
        </p>
        <p>
            In a routed export transaction, however, the Foreign Principal Party in Interest 
            (FPPI) must provide a POA or other written authorization to submit the EEI to either 
            the USPPI or  Blockchain Logistics LLC (U.S. Authorized).In most cases, the FPPI is
             your ultimate consignee or foreign customer.)

            There are instances when the EEI is not required. Some examples of when the EEI does not have to be 
            prepared by an exporter and filed by the carrier are as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
            Exporters sending shipments in which the ultimate destination is Canada, 
            as long as the goods are not licensed or contain rough or uncut diamonds, 
        </p>
        <p>
            Shipments to U.S. possessions (i.e. Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, 
            Midway Island, Wake Island and American Samoa). However, if 
            the shipments ultimate destination is the U.S. Virgin Islands 
            or Puerto Rico the EEI must be filed.
