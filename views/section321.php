        <h1>What is Section 321?</h1>
        <p>
            A Section 321 entry is a type of informal entry that allows the release of goods valued at $800 or less. 
            To be released under a Section 321, the shipment must not exceed $800 in value and must not be one of several 
            lots covered by a single order or contract. Section 321 entries may be claimed in conjunction with an eManifest filing, 
            subsequently reducing paperwork for low-value goods and allow faster clearance processing.

            Approved in 2016, a de minimis shipment commonly referred to as Section 321, allows for goods valued at $800 USD or less,
            to enter duty-free into the U.S. Under this legislation they are permitted to enter without formal entry. Therefore, this regulation 
            is a great option for importers to save money and time.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Section 321 exemption allows the consignee to become the importer themselves, 
            hence bypassing the duty payable on items purchased internationally, or outside 
            of the United States. 
            The limit for this shipment is $800 USD, and only 1 shipment per day per consignee.

<!--Section Restrictions -->

        <h1>Restrictions</h1>
        <p>
            The daily restriction for Section 321 goods is one 
            shipment per individual or company per day. 
            Importers cannot consolidate multiple Section 
            321 shipments into one shipment, because the total 
            value will then exceed $800. Each Section 321 
            shipment must be manifested separately on the eManifest 
            with a unique shipment control numbers (SCN).
        </p>
        <p>
            Most goods not exceeding $800 in value can be released as 
            a Section 321 entry, with a few exceptions: 
            goods requiring inspection before release (regardless of value)
            ,goods subject to Anti-Dumping / Countervailing duty (ADD/CVD), 
            quota-class goods, and goods regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 
            Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS), National 
            Highway Transport and Safety Administration (NHTSA), 
            Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSA), 
            and United States Department of Agriculture
            (USDA) can be released with Section 321 Entry Type 86. 
            CBP may refuse to clear a Section 321 shipment if 
            the shipment is deemed high risk for 
            a particular type of merchandise or class
