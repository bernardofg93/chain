            The advantage of <span>Multimodal Transport</span> 
            is given 
            by the most efficient combination of multiple 
            transport modes, optimizing lead times, reducing 
            inventory costs and keeping the level of freight 
            costs under control. This combination results in 
            increased environmental sustainability, reducing 
            the transportation carbon footprint.
            Combine sea, air, and ground for a
            cost-saving alternative to straight airfreight.

        <p>
            Blockchain logistics’ multimodal program combines 
            Sea+Air+Ground shipping services for savings over 
            straight airfreight shipments, all while maintaining 
            reasonable transit times. Combining Sea+Air+ Ground 
            shipping service can also help you minimize 
            destination warehouse charges.

                Multimodal shipments stay integrated within 
                our global network, systems, and operational procedures, 
                and receive Blockchain Logistics’ support from start to finish.
                Better transit time and performance
            </p>
            <p>
                times for multimodal service fall between normal air and 
                ocean shipments on the same lane, with time savings up to 
                50 percent over an ocean transit. Select Asian routes act 
                as capacity buffers and offer transit times similar to air 
                transit but perform much better thanks to space availability.
