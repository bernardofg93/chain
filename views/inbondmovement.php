            In-Bond - A procedure that allows the movement of 
            merchandise through the United States without payment 
            of duty and taxes prior to entry into domestic or foreign commerce.
            The merchandise must be covered by a custodial bond while 
            being transported. The bond protects the interest of CBP 
            and other agencies in the merchandise. In-bonds may not 
            be used for explosives or prohibited cargo.

            We provide Bonded Carriers services. We are authorized to

            under our bonded carrier to another U.S. port of entry 
            provided all statutory and regulatory conditions are met.
