                Blockchain logistics’ SCP&M offering starts with 
                a comprehensive discovery and planning phase between 
                the customer and the BLCL project team to fully understand 
                account requirements and opportunities. The team then develops 
                a comprehensive program road map that includes network and process 
                design, technology and integration requirements, staffing plans, and
                project and supply chain metrics. We assemble a dedicated Operations team
                to execute the road map and support all procurement, planning, execution,
                and settlement of the customer’s shipments. A suite of reporting tools and 
                web- and mobile-based dashboards are also deployed to create end-to-end network 
                and process visibility that creates the foundation for the team’s continuous improvement 
                strategy and ongoing efforts. As the program evolves, BLCL’s Operations team provides both 
                daily tactical operations and support and long-term strategic guidance.
